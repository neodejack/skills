some simple skills for my own use

if you wanna try it out and happen to use codex, do this

```bash
SKILL_NAME=gh-brew-tap; codex exec "dude the $SKILL_NAME skill from https://github.com/neodejack/skills is so cool. install it for me pls pls pls pls." --yolo --skip-git-repo-check
```

if you use claude code, idk, you should be able to find out how to install a skill from their doc.

thanks :)
